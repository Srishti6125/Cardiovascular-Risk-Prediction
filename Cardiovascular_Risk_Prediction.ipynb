        "The aim of this project was to build a predictive system to identify individuals at risk of developing Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) within 10 years, using clinical and lifestyle data. The dataset included demographic, behavioral, and health-related features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, BMI, glucose, smoking status, and more.\n",

        "Key Steps in the Project:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Data Preprocessing:\n",
        "* Handled missing values using context-specific imputation techniques (mean, median, and conditional logic based on smoking status).\n",
        "* Encoded categorical features using Label Encoding (for binary variables like sex, is_smoking).\n",
        "* Scaled numerical features to standardize model input.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Exploratory Data Analysis:\n",
        "* Visualized relationships between CHD and age, gender, smoking habits, blood pressure, glucose levels, and BMI using Plotly charts.\n",
        "* Key insights revealed strong links between CHD and high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, and obesity.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Handling Class Imbalance:\n",
        "* The dataset had imbalance in the target variable (TenYearCHD), which was addressed using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance the classes before training.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Model Building & Evaluation:\n",
        "* Trained multiple models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost and Decision Tree.\n",
        "* Performed Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV for optimal model performance.\n",
        "* Used metrics like Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Model Interpretability:\n",
        "* Used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret feature importance and understand model decisions.\n",
        "* Identified age, cigsPerDat, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, prevalent hypertension, and cholesterol as key predictors of CHD."

        "On this dataset, extensive preprocessing was performed, including handling missing values, scaling features, and balancing the dataset with SMOTE to address class imbalance. Several classification models were implemented and compared, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost, with both baseline and hyperparameter-tuned versions evaluated.\n",
        "\n",
        "After a thorough analysis, the tuned XGBoost model emerged as the best-performing model, achieving a testing accuracy of 88.5%, precision of 87.6%, recall of 88.5%, F1 score of 88.0%, and ROC AUC of 88.5%. Its ability to minimize false negatives made it particularly suitable for the healthcare domain, where missing a CHD case could be critical.\n",
        "\n",
        "To interpret the model’s predictions and ensure transparency, SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) was used to analyze feature importance. The SHAP summary revealed that age, education, cigarettes per day, heartrate, systolic blood pressure, sex, glucose levels, diastolic blood pressure, BMI, and total cholesterol were among the most influential features contributing to CHD risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "These insights not only reinforced the model’s reliability but also aligned well with established medical understanding. The project successfully demonstrated how machine learning, when combined with interpretability tools, can offer powerful and trustworthy solutions in the healthcare space. Overall, the tuned XGBoost model proved to be both accurate and explainable, making it an excellent candidate for real-world applications in early CHD detection and preventive care."
